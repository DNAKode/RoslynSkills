RoslynSkills is a Roslyn-native CLI/MCP toolchain (`roscli`) plus benchmark harnesses to test whether semantic tooling improves agent coding outcomes vs text-first baselines. Current published release is `v0.1.6-preview.14` (GitHub release + NuGet preview), and the current rollup/matrix is `benchmarks/experiments/20260213-approach-matrix-v0.1.6-preview.14.md` with supporting narrative in `RESEARCH_FINDINGS.md` and the active plan slice in `DETAILED_RESEARCH_PLAN.md` (P8.1).

The most important recent correctness finding is a workspace false-positive: `workspace_context.mode=workspace` can still yield nonsense diagnostics like `CS0518` (core types missing) if MSBuildWorkspace binds to an incompatible MSBuild instance (often VS MSBuild lagging preview TFMs). This is fixed in `src/RoslynSkills.Core/Commands/WorkspaceSemanticLoader.cs` by preferring `.NET SDK` MSBuild (`DiscoveryType.DotNetSdk`) during MSBuildLocator registration; it is regression-covered by `tests/RoslynSkills.Core.Tests/WorkspaceSemanticLoaderTests.cs` and documented as a benchmark validity gate in `ROSLYN_AGENTIC_CODING_RESEARCH_PROPOSAL.md` and `docs/WORKSPACE_CONTEXT_SMOKE.md`.

For fast roscli-vs-base comparisons, the primary harness is `benchmarks/scripts/Run-PairedAgentRuns.ps1`. It supports Codex reasoning effort via `-CodexReasoningEffort` (wired to `codex exec -c model_reasoning_effort="..."`), has guidance profiles including `brief-first-v2`/`workspace-locked`/`diagnostics-first`/`edit-then-verify`, and has an integrity switch `-FailOnMissingTreatmentRoslynUsage` to prevent treatment lanes silently becoming text-only; harness behavior is pinned by `tests/RoslynSkills.Benchmark.Tests/PairedRunHarnessScriptTests.cs`.

Large OSS realism runs are orchestrated by `benchmarks/scripts/Run-OssCsharpPilotRealRuns.ps1` and `benchmarks/experiments/oss-csharp-pilot-v1/manifest.json`. A FluentValidation pilot is recorded under `benchmarks/experiments/oss-csharp-pilot-v1/runs/20260213-095150-oss-csharp-pilot/`, but treat it as confounded for tool-effectiveness because the treatment lane recorded zero Roslyn tool calls and both lanes showed very high prompt/context pressure (1M+ input tokens); tighten “treatment required” integrity before interpreting deltas.

Immediate next steps: continue roscli vs base comparisons varying prompt posture, model (`gpt-5.3-codex` vs `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`), and reasoning effort, while enforcing validity gates (project tasks must show healthy workspace binding: mode=workspace plus no `CS0518`; treatment runs should fail closed if tools were not used). Use `benchmarks/scripts/Run-PairedAgentRuns.ps1 -SkipClaude -TaskShape project -RoslynGuidanceProfile brief-first-v2 -CodexModel gpt-5.3-codex-spark -CodexReasoningEffort low -FailOnMissingTreatmentRoslynUsage` for microtask sweeps; keep LSP-via-MCP as experimental until timeout/indexing confounds are resolved (see `benchmarks/LSP_COMPARATOR_PLAN.md`).
